  abstract = {Sport science can be thought of as a scientific process used to guide the practice of sport with the ultimate aim of improving sporting performance. However, despite this goal, the general consensus is that the translation of sport-science research to practice is poor. Furthermore, researchers have been criticised for failing to study problems relevant to practitioners and for disseminating findings that are difficult to implement within a practical setting. This paper proposes that the situation may be improved by the adoption of a model that guides the direction of research required to build our evidence base about how to improve performance. Central to the Applied Research Model for the Sport Sciences (ARMSS) described in this report is the idea that only research leading to practices that can and will be adopted can improve sporting performance. The eight stages of the proposed model are (i) defining the problem; (ii) descriptive research; (iii) predictors of performance; (iv) experimental testing of predictors; (v) determinants of key performance predictors; (vi) efficacy studies; (vii) examination of barriers to uptake; and (viii) implementation studies in a real sporting setting. It is suggested that, from the very inception, researchers need to consider how their research findings might ultimately be adapted to the intended population, in the actual sporting setting, delivered by persons with diverse training and skills, and using the available resources. It is further argued in the model that a greater understanding of the literature and more mechanistic studies are essential to inform subsequent research conducted in real sporting settings. The proposed ARMSS model therefore calls for a fundamental change in the way in which many sport scientists think about the research process. While there is no guarantee that application of this proposed research model will improve actual sports performance, anecdotal evidence suggests that sport-science research is not currently informing sport-science practice as we would hope and that sport-science researchers need to consider a new approach.},

The volume and immediate availability of this information allows coaches and sports scientists to make more informed decisions about current and future needs, thus increasing the teams' potential to perform. In the last decade, one of the most valuable technologies used in elite soccer is the Computerised video tracking system that quantifies technical and physical performance parameters, although new applications are being developed.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nOBJECTIVE: This systematic review aims to evaluate the pertaining research literature that has specifically used the Amisco and Prozone Computerised video tracking systems to analyse the physical performance of elite players.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nDATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, SPORTDiscus, PsycINFO, ProQuest, and Teseo were used for the literature search.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: After two selection phases, a total of 38 studies were reviewed, which revealed that the majority of studies were of a high standard with most fulfilling the majority of the quality criteria. A critical appraisal of this literature was conducted to assess issues regarding sample size, positional subsets, variables measured, and possible future applications.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: This systematic review demonstrates that Computerised video tracking systems are a valuable data collection tool to enable sports scientists to identify the current physical demands placed on players in competition to allow them to apply data to training and testing protocols. Current Computerised tracking systems in elite soccer still provide adequate detail on the physical and technical performances of players but must develop further to compete with the array of additional parameters offered by new technologies such as global or local positioning system technology. However, physical parameters are highly dependent on the role played by technical and tactical factors, and thus improved knowledge of these parameters is needed to allow a more complete understanding of their impact on physical demands.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Team sports are characterised by frequent episodes of accelerated/decelerated running. The corresponding energy cost can be estimated on the basis of the biomechanical equivalence between accelerated/decelerated running on flat terrain and constant speed running uphill/downhill. This approach allows one to: (i) estimate the time course of the instantaneous metabolic power requirement of any given player and (ii) infer therefrom the overall energy expenditure of any given time window of a soccer drill or match. In the original approach, walking and running were aggregated and energetically considered as running, even if in team sports several walking periods are interspersed among running bouts. However, since the transition speed between walking and running is known for any given incline of the terrain, we describe here an approach to identify walking episodes, thus utilising the corresponding energy cost which is smaller than in running. In addition, the new algorithm also takes into account the energy expenditure against the air resistance, for both walking and running. The new approach yields overall energy expenditure values, for a whole match,{$\approx$}14\% smaller than the original algorithm; moreover, it shows that the energy expenditure against the air resistance is{$\approx$}2\% of the total.},

  abstract = {In professional soccer, increasing amounts of data are collected that harness great potential when it comes to analysing tactical behaviour. Unlocking this potential is difficult as big data challenges the data management and analytics methods commonly employed in sports. By joining forces with computer science, solutions to these challenges could be achieved, helping sports science to find new insights, as is happening in other scientific domains. We aim to bring multiple domains together in the context of analysing tactical behaviour in soccer using position tracking data. A systematic literature search for studies employing position tracking data to study tactical behaviour in soccer was conducted in seven electronic databases, resulting in 2338 identified studies and finally the inclusion of 73 papers. Each domain clearly contributes to the analysis of tactical behaviour, albeit in\textendash sometimes radically\textendash different ways. Accordingly, we present a multidisciplinary framework where each domain's contributions to feature construction, modelling and interpretation can be situated. We discuss a set of key challenges concerning the data analytics process, specifically feature construction, spatial and temporal aggregation. Moreover, we discuss how these challenges could be resolved through multidisciplinary collaboration, which is pivotal in unlocking the potential of position tracking data in sports analytics. Highlights Over the recent years, there has been a considerable growth in studies on tactical behaviour using position tracking data, especially in the domains of sports science and computer science. Yet both domains have contributed distinctly different studies, with the first being more focused on developing theories and practical implications, and the latter more on developing techniques. Considerable opportunities exist for collaboration between sports science and computer science in the study of tactics in soccer, especially when using position tracking data. Collaborations between the domains of sports science and computer science benefit from a stronger dialogue yielding a cyclical collaboration. We have proposed a framework that could serve as the foundation for the combination of sports science and computer science expertise in tactical analysis in soccer.},

NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves               1               and in the first imaging of a black hole               2               . Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

Match analysis in professional football has predominately utilised notational analysis, a statistical summary of events based on video footage, to study the sport and prepare teams for competition. Recent increases in technology have facilitated the dynamic analysis of more complex process variables, giving practitioners the potential to quickly evaluate a match with consideration to contextual parameters. One field of research, known as machine learning, is a form of artificial intelligence that uses algorithms to detect meaningful patterns based on positional data. Machine learning is a relatively new concept in football, and little is known about its usefulness in identifying performance metrics that determine match outcome.

Analyses of team tactics require however detailed data from various sources including technical skill, individual physiological performance, and team formations among others to represent the complex processes underlying team tactical behavior. Accordingly, little is known about how these different factors influence team tactical behavior in elite soccer. In parts, this has also been due to the lack of available data. Increasingly however, detailed game logs obtained through next-generation tracking technologies in addition to physiological training data collected through novel miniature sensor technologies have become available for research. This leads however to the opposite problem where the shear amount of data becomes an obstacle in itself as methodological guidelines as well as theoretical modelling of tactical decision making in team sports is lacking. The present paper discusses how big data and modern machine learning technologies may help to address these issues and aid in developing a theoretical model for tactical decision making in team sports. As experience from medical applications show, significant organizational obstacles regarding data governance and access to technologies must be overcome first. The present work discusses these issues with respect to tactical analyses in elite soccer and propose a technological stack which aims to introduce big data technologies into elite soccer research. The proposed approach could also serve as a guideline for other sports science domains as increasing data size is becoming a wide-spread phenomenon.},

Data was captured at 5 Hz by GPS devices (SPI Pro, GPSports, Canberra, Australia) and analysed with non-linear signal processing methods. Approximate entropy values were lower in post-test situations suggesting that these time series became more regular with increasing expertise in football. Relative phase post-test values showed frequent periods with a clear trend to moving in anti-phase, as measured by players' distance to the centre of the team.

  abstract = {Abstract             SciPy is an open-source scientific computing library for the Python programming language. Since its initial release in 2001, SciPy has become a de facto standard for leveraging scientific algorithms in Python, with over 600 unique code contributors, thousands of dependent packages, over 100,000 dependent repositories and millions of downloads per year. In this work, we provide an overview of the capabilities and development practices of SciPy 1.0 and highlight some recent technical developments.},
