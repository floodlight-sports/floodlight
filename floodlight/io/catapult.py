    ----------
    players_sensor_data_dict_list : List[Dict] 
        A list of dictionaries, each containing sensor data for a player.

        The coordinate format to use for interpreting the position data. This determines how the coordinate values
        are extracted from the data:
        - "xy": Coordinates will be in the fields "x" and "y" of each entry.
        - "latlong": Coordinates will be in the fields "lat" (latitude) and "long" (longitude) of each entry.
        Defaults to "xy".

    Reads position data for a specific activity either from a saved response or by making an API request.

    Parameters
    ----------
    base_url : str
        The base URL for the API requests.
        Ensure you use the URL corresponding to the API for which you have credentials.
        For example, to access the European API, use "https://connect-eu.catapultsports.com/api/v6/".
    api_token : str
        The API token for authentication.
    activity_id : str
        The unique identifier for the activity.
    save : bool, optional
        Whether to save the players_sensor_data_dict_list to a file. Defaults to False.
    save_format : str, optional
        The format to use when saving the response data. It can be either "json" or "pickle".
        - "json": Saves the data in JSON format.
        - "pickle": Saves the data in pickle format.
        Defaults to "pickle".
    path_to_players_sensor_data_dict_list : str, optional
        The path to the saved players_sensor_data_dict_list file. If provided, data will be read from this path instead of making an API request.
    coord_format : str, optional
        The coordinate format to use for interpreting the position data. This determines how the coordinate values
        are extracted from the data:
        - "xy": Coordinates will be in the fields "x" and "y" of each entry.
        - "latlong": Coordinates will be in the fields "lat" (latitude) and "long" (longitude) of each entry.
        Defaults to "xy".

    Returns
    -------
    List[XY]
        A list of XY objects containing position data.

    Conditional Behavior
    --------------------
    1. If `path_to_players_sensor_data_dict_list` is provided:
       - The function reads the response data from the specified file path, skipping any API requests.

    2. If `path_to_players_sensor_data_dict_list` is not provided:
       - The function makes an API request to fetch the data.
       - If `save` is set to `True`, the fetched response is saved to files in both pickle and JSON formats.
       - If `save` is `False`, the response data is processed directly without saving.

    Notes
    -----
    - Ensure that the `path_to_players_sensor_data_dict_list` points to a valid file path containing previously saved response data.
    - The `coord_format` parameter allows flexibility in how position data is interpreted based on the available fields in the data.
    - The function `read_position_data_from_dict_list` converts the raw data dictionaries into `XY` objects.

    Example
    -------
    To fetch and process position data from an API, you might use:

    >>> base_url = "https://connect-eu.catapultsports.com/api/v6/"
    >>> api_token = "your_api_token_here"
    >>> activity_id = "your_activity_id_here"
    >>> data = read_position_data_from_activity(base_url, api_token, activity_id, save=True, coord_format="xy")

    In this example:
    - Data is fetched from the API.
    - The response is saved in both pickle and JSON formats.
    - Position data is processed into a list of `XY` objects using the "xy" coordinate format.

    Alternatively, to read data from a file:

    >>> path_to_file = "path/to/saved/players_sensor_data_dict_list.json"
    >>> data = read_position_data_from_activity(base_url, api_token, activity_id, path_to_players_sensor_data_dict_list=path_to_file, coord_format="latlong")

    In this case:
    - Data is read from the specified file path.
    - Position data is processed using the "latlong" coordinate format.
