        Tuple of (nested) floodlight core objects with shape (events_objects,

        ``events_objects`` is a nested dictionary containing ``Events`` objects for
        each team and segment of the form ``events_objects[segment][team] = Events``.
        For a typical league match with two halves and teams this dictionary looks like:

        of the form ``teamsheets[team] = Teamsheet``.

        ``pitch`` is a ``Pitch`` object corresponding to the data.

    Notes
    -----
    The DFL format of handling event data information involves an elaborate use of
    certain event attributes, which attach additional information to certain events.
    There also exist detailed definitions for these attributes. Parsing this information
    involves quite a bit of logic and is planned to be included in further releases. As
    of now, qualifier information is parsed as a string in the `qualifier` column of the
    returned DataFrame and might be transformed to a dict of the form:
    `{attribute: value}`.

    """Parse DFL files and extract position data, possession and ballstatus codes as
    well as pitch information and teamsheets.

    The structure of the official tracking system of the DFL (German Football League)
    contains two separate xml files, one containing the actual data as well as a
    metadata file containing information about teams, pitch size, and start- and
    endframes of match periods. However, since no information about framerate is
    contained in the metadata, the framerate is estimated from the time difference
    between individual frames. This function provides high-level access to DFL data by
    parsing "the full match" and returning XY- and Code-objects parsed from the position
    data xml-file as well as Pitch- and Teamsheet-objects parsed from the metadata
    xml-file.

    Parameters
    ----------
    filepath_positions: str or pathlib.Path
        Full path to XML File where the Position data in DFL format is saved.
    filepath_mat_info: str or pathlib.Path
        Full path to XML File where the Match Information data in DFL format is saved.
    teamsheet_home: Teamsheet, optional
        Teamsheet-object for the home team used to create link dictionaries of the form
        `links[team][jID] = xID` and  `links[team][pID] = jID`. The links are used to
        map players to a specific xID in the respective XY objects. Should be supplied
        for custom ordering. If given as None (default), teamsheet is extracted from the
        Match Information XML file and its xIDs are assigned in order of appearance.
    teamsheet_away: Teamsheet, optional
        Teamsheet-object for the away team. If given as None (default), teamsheet is
        extracted from the Match Information XML file. See teamsheet_home for details.

    Returns
    -------
    data_objects: Tuple[Dict[str, Dict[str, XY]], Dict[str, Code], Dict[str, Code], \
     Dict[str, Teamsheet], Pitch]
        Tuple of (nested) floodlight core objects with shape (xy_objects,
        possession_objects, ballstatus_objects, teamsheets, pitch).

        ``xy_objects`` is a nested dictionary containing ``XY`` objects for each team
        and segment of the form ``xy_objects[segment][team] = XY``. For a typical
        league match with two halves and teams this dictionary looks like:
        ``{
            'firstHalf': {'Home': XY, 'Away': XY},
            'secondHalf': {'Home': XY, 'Away': XY}
            }``.

        ``possession_objects`` is a dictionary containing ``Code`` objects with
        possession information (home or away) for each segment of the form
        ``possession_objects[segment] = Code``.

        ``ballstatus_objects`` is a dictionary containing ``Code`` objects with
        ballstatus information (dead or alive) for each segment of the form
        ``ballstatus_objects[segment] = Code``.

        ``teamsheets`` is a dictionary containing ``Teamsheet`` objects for each team
        of the form ``teamsheets[team] = Teamsheet``.

        ``pitch`` is a ``Pitch`` object corresponding to the data.
