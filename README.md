## A high-level, data-driven sports analytics framework

**floodlight** is a Python package for streamlined analysis of sports data. It is
designed with a clear focus on scientific computing and built upon popular libraries
such as *numpy* or *pandas*.

Load, integrate, and process tracking and event data, codes and other match-related
information from major data providers. This package provides a set of  standardized
data objects to structure and handle sports data, together with a suite of common
processing operations such as transforms or data manipulation methods.

All implementations run completely provider- and sports-independent, while maintaining
a maximum of flexibility to incorporate as many data flavours as possible. A high-level
interface allows easy access to all standard routines, so that you can stop worrying
about data wrangling and start focussing on the analysis instead!

### Quick Demo

**floodlight** simplifies sports data loading, processing and advanced performance
analyses. Check out the example below, where querying a public data sample, filtering
the data and computing the expended metabolic work of the active home team players is
done in a few lines of code:

```
>>> from floodlight.io.datasets import EIGDDataset
>>> from floodlight.transforms.filter import butterworth_lowpass
>>> from floodlight.models.kinetics import MetabolicPowerModel

>>> dataset = EIGDDataset()
>>> home_team_data, away_team_data, ball_data = dataset.get()

>>> home_team_data = butterworth_lowpass(home_team_data)

>>> model = MetabolicPowerModel()
>>> model.fit(home_team_data)
>>> metabolic_power = model.cumulative_metabolic_power()

>>> print(metabolic_power[-1, 0:7])

### Why

Why do we need another package that introduces its own data structures and ways of dealing with certain problems?
And what's the purpose of trying to integrate all different data sources and fit them into a single framework?
Especially since there already exist packages that aim to solve certain parts of that pipeline?

Our answer is - although we love those packages out there - that we did not find a solution that did fit our needs.
Available packages are either tightly connected to a certain data format/provider, adapt to the subtleties of a
particular sport, or solve *one* particular problem. This still left us with the essential problem of adapting to
different interfaces.

We felt that as long as there is no underlying, high-level framework, each and every use case again and again needs its
own implementation. At last, we found ourselves refactoring the same code - and there are certain data processing or
plotting routines that are required in *almost every* project - over and over again just to fit the particular data
structures we're dealing with at that time.
